<h1>A Noobs Guide to NixOS</h1>

<p>This is a Guide for NixOS, by a Noob, for Noobs. I will try to document everything I know about NixOS (which is not much) here so that hopefully others can skip some of the trial and error. If you want to read more about this Guide, go <a href="introduction.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>To get started, you should follow <a href="first-steps.html">this list</a> for your first steps with NixOS.</p>
