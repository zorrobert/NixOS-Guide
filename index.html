<h1>A Noobs Guide to NixOS</h1>

<p>This is a Guide for NixOS, by a Noob, for Noobs. I will try to document everything I know about NixOS (which is not much) here so that hopefully others can skip some of the trial and error. If you want to read more about this Guide, read the <a href="introduction.html">introduction</a>.</p>

<p>To get started, you should follow <a href="first-steps.html">this list</a> for your first steps with NixOS.</p>

<p>If you are confused by the vocabulary. take a look <a href="vocabulary.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>for a very breif explanation of some functions, take a look <a hraf="tldr.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Now you should have a basic understanding of NixOS. Feel free to jump into any of the following sections depending on what you want to know.</p>
