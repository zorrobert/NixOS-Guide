<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2>What is NixOS?</h2>
<p>NixOS is a Linux distribution with the goal of providing a reproducible system. This means that there is a config file that you use to define the state of you system, such as what programs are installed, what users exist, localisation and network settings and so much more.</p>

<h2>What are the advantages?</h2>
<p>Portability: Because the state of the whole system (except for files) is defined in a single file, reinstalling or moving the system to a new machine is very easy and fast because you do not need to reconfigure anything.</p>

<p>Reproducible: The way apps/programs are installed is the same for everyone using NixOS, which means that errors can be resolved faster.</p>

<h2>What are the disadvantages?</h2>
<p>Documentation: limited, outdated, not helpful for new users, lacks practical examples</p>

<h2>Why NixOS?</h2>
<p>For me there are two main reasons why I like NixOS:
    <ol>
        <li>Reinstalling my system is very easy. When I started using Linux I often had to reinstall because I borked my install. This was very annoying because installing and configuring takes a long time. With NixOS, a big chunk of the reconfiguration is done for me.</li>
        <li>I know the state of my system. With other Distros, the state of the system slowly deteriorates, I forgot to remove temporary stuff and after a  few month I always felt like doing a reinstall to get rid of all the junk from when I messed up. With NixOS, I <i>know</i> that my system is "clean", because everything is listed as part of my configuration and I always know what I have available on my system.</li>
    </ol>
