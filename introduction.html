    Why NixOS stuck

    My full OS setup is simple: I only require Emacs and Firefox. Even then, I’ve found that when using other Linux distros, the state of the system slowly but surely deteriorates into a spaghetti-like mess. In NixOS, only sh and /usr/bin/env is available by default. Everything else is declaratively added into your root system. This way, I’m always aware of exactly what I have available on my system.</p>
