<h1>First steps</h1>

<p>To get started with NixOS, you should just install and use the system for a bit before getting into more advanced configurations. To do that, you do not need any knowledge about how NixOS works, so just follow along.</p>

<h2 id="installing-nixos">Installing NixOS</h2>

<p>This section is about the installation and first setup of NixOS.</p>

<p>TL;DR Ti's just like installing Linux Mint or Ubuntu.</p>

<p>After installing NixOS, you will find a file called <code>configuration.nix</code> under <code>/etc/nixos</code>. This is where we will configure our system.</p>

<h2 id="installing-packages">Installing Packages</h2>
<p>Installing packages on NixOS is different than on Debian-based systems and you have different options for how you want to install a package.</p>
<ol>
    <li>nix-shell
        If you only need a small cli tool to run a few commands, you can install a package only for your shell session. This means that once you exit that shell, the program is removed again.
    </li>
    <li>system package

        <p>System Package:
            <code>
            environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
                firefox
            ];
            </code>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>user package:
        <br>

        <p>User Package:
            <code>
            users.users.[username].packages = with pkgs; [
                firefox
            ];
            </code>
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    
    <br>On NixOS, instead of running a command like <code>sudo apt install firefox</code>, you put a list of packages that you want into your <code>configuration.nix</code> and they will be installed for you. You can remove packages by simply deleting them from you list of packages.<br>
    You can install new packages on your NixOS system either as <u>system packages</u> or as <u>user packages</u>.</p>
